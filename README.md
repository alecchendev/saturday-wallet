# Saturday Wallet

A [daily spending](https://bitcoin.design/guide/daily-spending-wallet/) Bitcoin + Lightning wallet.

Runs on desktop using Tauri + SolidJS, although it's designed for mobile.

Uses [ldk-node](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-node) for the wallet backend.

Named [Saturday because I first started this on a Saturday](https://github.com/reez/Monday#thanks) :)
